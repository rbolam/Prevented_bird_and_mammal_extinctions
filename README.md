# Prevented bird and mammal extinctions
This repository contains data, code and outputs for prevented bird and mammal extinctions project.

## Script folder
All scripts to reproduce figures are contained here. There is a script for each figure. For medians, there are separate plots for birds and mammals. For maps, threats and conservation actions, scripts will create three different figures: for all candidate species, for species with a median above 50% for the 1993 - 2020 time period, and for species with a median above 50% for the 2010 - 2020 time period. 

## Output folder
All figures are saved into this folder.

## Data folder
Here all data are deposited. allspp_medians.csv' contains the evaluators' median scores for all species for both the 1993 - 2020 time period and the 2010 - 2020 time period; the lowest, best and highest estimates; the agreement; and the order for plotting. 'Conservation.actions.csv' contains actions as listed on the species' Red List accounts and mapped to the IUCN action classification scheme. The folder 'RL_data_29_01_2020' contains relevant Red List information downloaded on 29 January 2020.
